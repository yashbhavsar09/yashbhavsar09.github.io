         <p class="font1">In April 2024, a news report outlined that social media personality Tanmay Bhat's net worth was said to be more than 650 crore rupees. Sounds pretty cool. Bhat responded to this claim, remarking that the number was wildly off. Nonetheless, it seems like he may be pretty well-off. Content creators in the creator economy, like Bhat, MrBeast, MostlySane or others, may be pretty successful.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">In 2022, according to Kalaari Capital, India had about 80 million content creators. But, only about 150,000 of them can effectively monetize their services. The 150k of them were said to be earning about $200 to $2500, which is about 16,000 rupees to 200,000 rupees a month. Less than 1% of professional creators with more than a million followers were said to be earning more than 50 lakh rupees a month. However, that could just mean some do better than others, that happens in all industries.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">And sure, the creator economy could signify the power of independence and individual creativity. </p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">But, are there certain hurdles that creators face that could be solved by Blockchain? It's said that content creators in the creator economy are struggling with monetization models relying heavily on intermediaries. Could Blockchain disrupt this paradigm and help with better monetization avenues?</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">According to Siddharth Ugrankar, CEO & Co-Founder at Qila.io, "The creator economy is estimated to be around $104 billion. Like various industries, the creator economy, also, relies on monetization models that impact the entire ecosystem. One might argue that since established and reliable platforms, like YouTube, TikTok and Facebook, are involved, there's, already, transparency and fairness. But this assumption may not be accurate owing to the federated nature of these platforms".</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">According to Rajagopal Menon, Vice President at WazirX, "The channels that creators use are consolidated platforms owned by the Big Tech companies in Web 2.0. Top influencers earn around $0.02 and $0.04 for every 1000 views on TikTok. Similarly, Youtube gives 45% to 55% revenue share from advertisements to creators. Even if these platforms fully transition to Web 3.0, they will ensure that profits from the creators largely benefit the platforms. With blockchain, there will be fewer intermediaries where creators can connect with their audience one-on-one and get incentivized through exclusive mediums where there is no ownership. This puts control in the hands of the creators and enables them to create new income streams, allowing them to earn recurring income through royalties".</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">Ugrankar remarks, "As of now, both Apple and Google follow a stringent compliance process and financial model, where developers or digital content creators are required to follow a payment policy that is fully dictated by companies. Google controls over 95% of the smartphone market in India, thereby giving them full control of one-sided payment compliance and fee structure. Technology, like Blockchain, can allow the same set of developers an aggressive pricing model to offer the service directly to the users but with more control and authority using decentralized Apps (DApps), while also maintaining the confidentiality of access and authenticity of services & transparent payment processes. This would also achieve needed compliance with the regulatory framework applicable to the industry. The creator marketplace approach powered by Blockchain would empower the developers to connect to the possible base of consumers directly. Blockchain is a true disrupter as it gives control to owners, consumers, purchases and users with full traceability and transparency in the connected ecosystem". Though, that primarily focuses on app developers as creators.</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">Some of the USPs of blockchain are its transparency and decentralization. How could these features create more trust between creators in the creator economy and their audiences?</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">Ugrankar remarks, "Records created on the Blockchain platform are immutable and stored in chains of blocks with time stamps giving the provenance of the asset creation, which could be digital or physical. These attributes can trace the original creator, the audience consuming this knows that the content is genuine and is created by the claimed author. This helps build transparency, trust and accountability of the creator. And in an ideal decentralized network, the content creator is directly dealing with its end-consumer with minimum to no intermediaries. This helps the creator to connect with their audience directly which, in return, builds trust. This, also, empowers the content creator with more control over their content in terms of how it is shared and monetized".</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">Menon remarks, "The aim of Blockchain is to decentralize the Internet, which is heavily concentrated and owned by a few powerful people, who change the rules based on their whims. This means issues like creators being wrongfully reported for violation of rules, losing followers, relying on algorithms for discovery by potential audiences and more. Even the former US President was powerless against this, when he was deplatformed during his term. With Blockchain, any manipulation can be traced back to its source and, also, help in establishing tamper-proof ownership records. Creators can, also, verify the authenticity of their content with this to foster better relations with their audiences".</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">So, if Blockchain could trace the original creator, what could that mean for intellectual property rights? Could Blockchain be leveraged to establish and enforce certain compensation mechanisms that creators see as fair? And could creators better retain ownership of their work?</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">"While IP, which could be a patent, a copyright or a trademark may be a legal way to protect innovation, original work or what a creator makes, the cost and compliance procedures associated with the IP would be high and the timeline associated with the implementation would be also expensive until the patent is granted", states Ugrankar.</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">"Smart contracts on the blockchain platform can be used to automate revenue-sharing among the collaborators based on predetermined terms and the associated business logic. This reduces any disputes or ambiguity between the collaborators and creates a fair and transparent monetizing system. One of the key concerns of original creators is someone taking credit for their hard work. The essence of Blockchain technology is a viable alternative if the original work or innovation can be validated using it. The core attributes of Blockchain are the distributed nature of storing the information where information is written in blocks and stored using the chain of blocks to achieve authenticity, originality and traceability. For example, an original painting of an artist can be thought to have a digital tokenized presence in the Blockchain ledger that can be traced back to the creator using the Blockchain. In such a case, authenticity associated with the painting can be achieved using the digital warranty certificate available in the system in the form of tokens or NFTs. If the creator plans to sell the painting, they can do so by, also, transferring the NFT token to the respective buyer who, after the purchase and transfer of the token in their name, would become the new token owner. As a third party interested in tracing the painting, they could do so by going through the history of records in the Blockchain system. The Blockchain system maintains a digital twin of a physical record while giving full control to legit users", adds Ugrankar.</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">Menon adds, "IP rights can be established on Blockchain, since it's immutable. In case of any forgery or counterfeit, it can be contested by creators, which doesn't happen through existing media channels. For example, there are rampant incidents of popular production houses using music created by independent artists without giving them their due credit or royalty. This can be curbed if ownership lies with the creators in the form of NFTs and can only be sold for profits to interested parties. Revenues can also be traced without the scope of any manipulation".</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">All of that sounds great. But, what could the on-the-ground challenges be for implementing something like this?</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">Menon opines, "Despite its benefits, Blockchain, as a technology, can be complex to navigate. While projects are working on simple UI/UX to onboard new users and non-tech natives, it could be a while before Blockchain sees significant adoption, as it would require equal participation from creators and their audience. If Blockchain doesn't integrate itself with existing networks, which are already popular, it could be a while before it gets adopted en masse. So, some creators might find themselves stagnated on a network without much growth or new market exposure. Scalability is something that blockchains are still struggling with. Even the ones who have been around for years face challenges when processing several transactions at once. This could hinder the reach of creators and timely release of their content".</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">  "Blockchain technology is new and its utility aspect has been explored across sectors due to its unique offerings. Blockchain got notoriety with the advent of cryptocurrency, which is one of its initial applications. The tech has been worked on to tackle different problems using the core attributes, however, to implement it effectively, technical expertise is required to set up the network and write the smart contract & a skilled workforce is needed. Many content creators may not have the necessary knowledge or resources to integrate blockchain into their workflow. Plus, the regulatory and legal landscape for Blockchain is evolving across nations with diverse viewpoints. Content creators need more clarity on how blockchain-based transactions and smart contracts fit with their existing regulatory framework, how Blockchain monetization can be taxed or how it is regulated. With the advent of CBDC, Indian regulators insist on having more control on decentralized systems, making them more centralized and controlled", opines Ugrankar.</p>
         <br>   
         <p class="font1">"And creators can foster exclusive content which can be accessed through fan tokens. They can build their own community, which can act as a decentralized circle of a like-minded audience, while, also, working out some form of reward-sharing model for contributors among the community members", quips Menon.</p>
         <br>
         <p class="font1">So, what does it take to build a more equitable, transparent and sustainable creator economy in India?</p>
